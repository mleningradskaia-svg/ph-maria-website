    "bio": "I'm Maria Leningradskaya — a lifestyle and portrait photographer based in Illinois. For the past **7 years**, families, couples, women, and men have trusted me to capture the moments that truly matter — whether it's a milestone, a personal portrait session, or photos for a business portfolio.\n\nAs a mom of two daughters, I know just how important it is to preserve family memories. I absolutely love working with kids and creating natural, heartfelt portraits.\n\nPhotography is more than a job to me — it's my passion. I'm based in Chicago and shoot throughout Illinois, and I'm always open to travel for sessions in other states too."
